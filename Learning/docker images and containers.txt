1.docker pull imagename(ex. jenkins , tomcat)--> to download docker image
2. docker images
docker image ls --> to see list of docker images
3.docker rmi imagename --> to remove/delete an image from docker host
4. docker build -t imagename .
-t for tagname
. represents current working directory
5. docker login --> to login to docker hub
6. docker push --> to push a image into docker hub
7. docker tag container name or containerid --> to create an image from container
8. docker search image name --> to search an image in docker hub

containers:

1. docker container ls --> to see list of running docker containers
2. docker ps -a --> to see list of both running and stopped containers
3. docker stop containername or containerid --> to stop container
4. docker start containername or containerid --> to start container
5. docker restart containername or containerid --> to restart container
6. docker restart -t 10 containername or containerid --> to restart after 10 seconds
7. docker rm containername or containerid --> to remove container which is stopped)
8. docker rm -f containername or containerid --> to remove container which is running)
9. docker stop $(docker ps -aq) --> to stop all running containers
10. docker rm $(docker ps -aq) --> to delete all stopped containers
11. docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq) --> to delete all running containers

to create a new container :
docker inspect containername or container id ( to see entire information of container)
docker run [options] imagename
--name (to assign name to container)
-d (runs container as a daemon) (i,e. it will run in background in detache module)
-it (to open an interactive terminal in the container where we can execute linux commands)
--network (starts container on a specific network)
-v (to attach an external volume to the container)
--volume-from (used for creating reusable volumes that can be shared between multiple containers)
-p (used for port mapping)
-P (this will automatically map the port of container , portnumber will be greaterthan 10000)
-e (used for passing environmental variable to containers)
-rm (this will delete container on exit from the container)

docker attach containername(or)id --> to go into the shell of an already running container which has a shell opened)
docker exec -it containername/containerid --> to go into a container and open a new shell

network commands :

1. docker network ls (to see list of all available networks)
2. docker network create networkname ( to create new network)
3. docker network inspect networkname ( to know complete information of that particular network)
4. docker network connect networkname/containername/container id (to attach a network to running container) 
5. docker network rm networkname/network id (to delete a network)
6. docker network disconnect networkname/containername/container id (to

types of network :

1. bridge network
2. null or none
3. host only
4. overlay
