Parameterized Jobs :

1.Start jenkins
2.Manage jenkins->manage plugins->parameterized trigger
3.Create new freestyle job(develop1)->this project is parameterized->string
4.Create another freestyle job(develop2)->post buils actions->parameterized->project name: develop1->when buils is stable
5.Now run develop2 and even develop1 will also run

I describe how to set up Jenkins and GitHub so that a build is triggered when a change is pushed to a specific branch

Build Automatically Using Webhook When Changes Made In Git:

On the GitHub web site:
a.Go to your repositoryâ€™s page on GitHub.
b.Select Settings, Webhooks, Add webhook
c.In the Payload URL enter:
https://jenkins.princeton.edu/github-webhook/
d.In Content type select: application/json.
e.In the box Which events would you like to trigger this webhook? select Just the push event.
f.Click on Add webhook.
g.Once your webhook has been created, you will get a message on the top of
your browser window that reads:
Okay, that hook was successfully created. We sent a ping payload to
test it out! Read more about it at
https://developper.github.com/webhooks/#ping-event.
h.As you see GitHub sent a ping to the jenkins server. You can check that
i.it was successful by clicking on the webhook we just created,
j.Scroll down to the Recent Deliveries and look at the response, you should
have a 200 return code that is green, otherwise something went wrong.

When Changes Made To Specific Branch In Github :

First u need to have branches in git otherthan master(ex : branch1 , branch2 , branch3 , branch4 , branch5)

On your Jenkins job page:
i.Go to Configure.
ii.Select the Source Code Management tab.
iii.In the Branch to Build section, Branch Specifier (blank for 'any'), then enter the branch you want to follow, here I am following the branch1.
iv.In the Build Triggers tab, select GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling.
v.Click Save.
